This simple project shows how Async Hooks can help find automatically find the original HTTP request that trigerred an error.

It was generated with:
  express --view=ejs myapp
The only files which we modified after are:
  myapp/app.js: the modified section is explicitely delimited by comments
  myapp/asyncHooksDoctrineSimplified.js: this is core of the async hooks implementation

To run it (you need at least Node.js 8):
  cd myapp
  npm install
  npm start

Then to test the concept:
  Go to http://localhost:3000/ to check the app is running (you should see "Welcome to Express")
  Go to http://localhost:3000/crash1 or http://localhost:3000/crash2
  
The application will crash, but you should be able to see in the console whether it was /crash1 or /crash2 that triggered the crash. The is the value added by our Async Hooks system.

Example here with crash1:
*** Application crashed (uncaught exception) ***

Path triggering the error (this is the magic): /crash1
TypeError: Cannot set property 'crash' of null
