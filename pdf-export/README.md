# PDF Export x Doctrine

## Demo

You can find the 4 versions of the PDF export we had at Doctrine

The fist one leverages [html2pdf here](static/html2pdf.html)

The second one uses [phantomjs here](phantomjs.mjs)

The third one uses [wkhtmltopdf here](wkhtmltopdf.mjs)

And the last and still used in production one uses [puppeteer here](puppeteer.mjs)
